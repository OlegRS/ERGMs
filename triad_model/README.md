# Triad and MF models
In this project we analyse triad exponential random graph model introduced in seminal work by O. Frank and D. Strauss (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216632880_Markov_Graphs) and its mean field analogue (MF model) defined by the Hamiltonian which depends solely on the powers of connectance. It turns out that MF model can be solved using the PDE-based techniques and these analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations implemented in this repo. In thermodynamic limit triad model also agrees with the theory at the macroscopic level, but shows complex finite size behaviour, which was first observed and reported by O. Frank and D. Strauss.
